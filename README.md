# node3-Weather_website_app

This app is a personal project to learn about nodejs.
I use api.mapbox.com to determine the location of the given location and
weatherstack.com api to take and display the weather forecast.

Feel free to use it!

Instructions:

Just clone and do "npm install" at the route folder.
The defined script to run the app localhost is "npm run dev"( that command is 
equal with "nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs,css" if you have nodemon globally installed.
